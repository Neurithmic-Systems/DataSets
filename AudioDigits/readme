This dataset consists of two zip files.  Each contains 110 samples of 11 spoken digits, 0-9, and also "oh" (i.e., some people say "oh" instead of "zero"). There are five
speakers and there are two instances of each digit for a total of 5x22 samples.  The samples comes from Dan Ellis (https://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/sounds/) "Clean digits"
derived from TIDIGITS.  These are .wav file sampled at 22 khz.  Codie Petersen created Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) versions of these files with 32
frequencies, discretized to 20 power levels.  The time window for each frame is XXX and the time window delta wa XXX.  This resulted in about 25-40 frames per sample. The
MFCC samples were then converted into Sparsey's "raw" format.  Specifically, each frequency bin is represented by 40 bits and each power level is represented by a contiguous
block of 20 "on" bits.  Level 0 is represented by bits 0-19 active, level 1, by bits 1-20 active,....level 19 by bits 20-39 active.  This format is essential because it
captures the complete similarity relations between power levels across the full range of power levels.  That is, level 0's input representation (bits 0-19) has an intersection
of 19 bits with level 1's representation (1-20), but only 18 bits with level 2's representation (2-21), etc.,..., and finally, of only 1 bit with level 20's representation
(20-39).  Thus, similarity in the input space (scalar magnitude) is preserved in the input representation.

In Sparsey's "raw" format, the bits are actually represented by bytes, "1" bits by hex 00 and "0" by hex FF.
